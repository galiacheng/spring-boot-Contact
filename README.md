# Spring-boot-Contact
A Simple Contact management Application implemented using Spring Boot &amp; Spring Data JPA 

This Application is built for learning Spring boot , Hibernate with Spring Data JPA , Hibernate Validator.It doesn't concentrate much on UI part.

It uses only three tables 

User          - to manage login <br>
Contact       - to Store User's contact information like name , Email id (Like Contacts in Phone) 
                and it has unidirectional many to one mapping with User .<br>
ContactPhone  - to Store Phone numbers(yes! can store more phone number for each contact) information for 
                 each contact and it has unidirectional many to one mapping with Contact.<br>
<br>               
As part of Spring MVC , this application implements
 - Request Mapping using annotations and usage of Controller,Repository annotations
 - Front End Forms to Back End DataBinding
 - Autowiring of required objects
 - Redirection from one controller to another using flashattributes<br>
 
As part of Hibernate Validator, this application implements
 - Null check , length check using annotations
 - Cross field verification using class level user defined annotations
 - Usage Valid and bindingresult annotation in controller classes<br>
 
 As part of Spring Data JPA 
 - Usage of CRUD repository 
 - Usage of findBy and delete methods using different name patterns<br>
 
As part of Hibernate ORM
  - Usage of Entity , ID annotations
  - Usage of Mapping annotations, used only unidirectional Many to One mapping
  - Usage of Query and Param annotations while using JPQL 
  - Usage of Transactional annotations while deleteby pattern methods <br>
  
 
 What features can be implemented further ?
 
 - AOP for logging and security session check before accessing crtical controller methods
 - Hibernate - Fetch Type 
 - Spring Session using Redis Db for clustered session management<br>
 
Updates:<br>
In order to have easy development , created branch h2_database which uses in memory h2 database .

h2-database & aop-brach has following updates
  - Aspectj is used for implementing cross cutting concern like logging and session checker 
  - As part of Aspectj , we can learn usage of annotation like Aspect,Point Cut expression,Around & Before advice types.
